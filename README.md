Anyone who wants to contribute to the project should create their own branch.  This will allow you to update your progress in github without ruining anyone else's.

To create your own branch, follow the steps below:
1. Select the branch drop-down at the top of the list of files.
1. Type in your first name to create your own branch.
1. Create the branch and make sure you are under your branch before making any changes.

## Pull Requests
You are allowed to update your branch by pulling the master branch into your branch.

If you want to add your changes to the master branch, create a pull request and explain what you added to the game.  We will determine which pull requests we will push to the master branch at the next time we meet.

**Make sure your branch is up to date with the master branch before making any changes.**
